# Report a Compounding Engineering Plugin Bug

Report bugs encountered while using the compound-engineering plugin. This command gathers structured information and prepares a bug report for the maintainer.

## Step 1: Gather Bug Information

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to collect the following information:

**Question 1: Bug Category**
- What type of issue are you experiencing?
- Options: Agent not working, Command not working, Skill not working, MCP server issue, Installation problem, Other

**Question 2: Specific Component**
- Which specific component is affected?
- Ask for the name of the agent, command, skill, or MCP server

**Question 3: What Happened (Actual Behavior)**
- Ask: "What happened when you used this component?"
- Get a clear description of the actual behavior

**Question 4: What Should Have Happened (Expected Behavior)**
- Ask: "What did you expect to happen instead?"
- Get a clear description of expected behavior

**Question 5: Steps to Reproduce**
- Ask: "What steps did you take before the bug occurred?"
- Get reproduction steps

**Question 6: Error Messages**
- Ask: "Did you see any error messages? If so, please share them."
- Capture any error output

## Step 2: Collect Environment Information

Automatically gather:
```bash
# Get plugin version
cat ~/.copilot/plugins/installed_plugins.json 2>/dev/null | grep -A5 "compound-engineering" | head -10 || echo "Plugin info not found"

# Get Claude Code version
claude --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Claude CLI version unknown"

# Get OS info
uname -a
```

## Step 3: Format the Bug Report

Create a well-structured bug report with:

```markdown
## Bug Description

**Summary:** [Brief description from argument or collected info]

## Environment

*Reported via `/report-bug` command*
```

## Step 4: Save Bug Report

Save the formatted bug report so the user can file it:

```bash
cat > /tmp/bug-report.md <<'BUGREPORT'
[Formatted bug report from Step 3]
BUGREPORT
echo "Bug report saved to /tmp/bug-report.md"
```

Inform the user:
- "Bug report saved to `/tmp/bug-report.md`"
- "Please file this as an issue in the plugin repository or share it with the maintainer (The Rabak)"

## Output Format
